# Add ability to swap running agent in orch monitor run dashboard

Add a 'Swap Agent' button/command to the orch monitor run dashboard. This allows the user to replace the currently active agent for a run with a different one (e.g., switching from Codex to Claude) without losing the run context. This is useful when an agent fails due to API limits, network issues, or other errors, allowing the user to delegate the remaining task to another agent.
