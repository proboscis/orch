# Configure default PR target branch in .orch/config.yaml

Add a configuration option in .orch/config.yaml to specify the default target branch for Pull Requests created by agents. Currently, agents default to targeting 'main'. Users should be able to define a preferred target branch (e.g., 'develop' or a feature branch).
