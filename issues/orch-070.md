# Enhance orch monitor Continue option with branch and agent selection dialogue

The 'Continue' option in the orch monitor's issue dashboard currently resumes a run directly. It should instead open a dialogue that allows the user to:
1. Select the specific branch/run to resume (if multiple exist or to confirm the target).
2. Select the agent to use for the continued session (allowing switching agents or confirming the current one).
This improves control when resuming work on an issue.
