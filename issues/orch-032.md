# Add resolve keybinding (R) to orch monitor

Add a keybinding to orch monitor so users can select a run and press the R key to:
1. Mark the run as completed
2. Mark the corresponding issue as resolved

This provides a quick way to resolve runs and their issues directly from the monitor TUI without running separate commands.
