# Configure worktree branch naming convention in .orch/config.yaml

Add support for customizing the branch naming convention for worktrees in .orch/config.yaml. Users should be able to define a template string (e.g., '<user-space>/issue/<doeff-generated-name>') to control how branches are named when starting a run.
