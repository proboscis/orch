# Fix memory leak in cache service

The cache service is leaking memory when entries expire.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Start the service with a small cache TTL (10s)
2. Generate load for 10 minutes
3. Observe memory growth

## Expected behavior

Memory should remain stable after cache reaches max size.

## Actual behavior

Memory grows unbounded.
